## Why such a name, what does it mean?
Heinzel or Heinzelm√§nnchen - in German folklore, a homely spirit, for a modest fee - a jug of milk or a saucer of cream - he will do almost all the housework: washing dishes, sweeping the floors, taking care of livestock.

So this program, like a helper spirit, helps to quickly get to work by displaying a list of programs. And unlike a magical creature, it does not even require a jug of milk.

## Features:

- nice and minimalistic interface
- lightness
- a small number of lines of code, which allows you to quickly make changes to the code base
- simple config file
